libdnf
======

This library provides a high level package-manager. It's core library of [dnf](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf), [PackageKit](https://github.com/hughsie/PackageKit) and [rpm-ostree](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree). It's replacement for deprecated [hawkey library](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/hawkey) which it contains inside and uses [librepo](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/librepo) under the hood.

:warning: :warning: :warning:
**Note that libdnf is currently being reworked and is
considered unstable. Once major users like PackageKit and
DNF are fully ported, a new stable release will be
considered.**

Building for Fedora
===================

To install build requirements, run following command:

    dnf install check-devel cmake cppunit-devel gcc gcc-c++ glib2-devel gtk-doc json-c-devel libmodulemd-devel librepo-devel libsolv-devel libsolv-tools make python2-devel python3-devel python2-nose python3-nose python2-sphinx python3-sphinx rpm-devel sqlite-devel swig libsmartcols-devel

From the checkout dir:

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake .. -DPYTHON_DESIRED=3
    make

Building the documentation, from the build/ directory::

    make doc

Building RPMs:

    tito build --rpm --test

Tests
=====

All unit tests should pass after the build finishes:

    cd build/tests
    make tests

There are two parts of unit tests: unit tests in C and unit tests in Python. To run the C part of the tests manually, from hawkey checkout::

    build/tests/test_main tests/repos/

Manually executing the Python tests::

    PYTHONPATH=`readlink -f ./build/src/python/` nosetests -s tests/python/tests/

The PYTHONPATH is unfortunately needed as the Python test suite needs to know where to import the built hawkey modules.

Documentation
=============

See the [hawkey documentation page](http://hawkey.readthedocs.org).

Information internal to the hawkey development is maintained on a [github wiki](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf/wiki#wiki-Contact).
